    <td>Summary</td>
    <td>Decidim [https://decidim.org] is a digital infrastructure for participatory democracy written on free software (Ruby on Rails), which enables the creation of citizen participation portals. Users of the platform (participants) interact through participatory mechanisms known as components which provide specific functions for the various participatory spaces. In other words, participatory spaces such as Initiatives, Assemblies, Processes and Consultations have components at their disposal which work together as participatory mechanisms. The more notable components include in-person meetings, surveys, proposals, votes, results monitoring and comments. For example, the various stages of a specific participatory process, such as the preparation of participatory budgets, can incorporate various components to: convene and capture the results of in-person meetings with citizens, conduct a survey, make proposals and, during the final stages of the process, hold a vote to decide on the projects with a budget expenditure system (always after a period for commentary and debate), conduct an assessment survey and, finally, monitor the implementation of the projects selected.</td>

    <td>Document history</td>
    <td>This document includes a description of the current functions in Decidim and also those that are in the development or award phase (defined in the specifications of the public tender contract for the development of Decidim, as published by Barcelona City Council, dossier code 17000141). Hundreds of people have taken part in designing the current and proposed functions, during the 2016 Annual Metadecidim Conferences, in the Metadecidim participatory process for Barcelona City Council’s participatory portal and in the monthly meetings of SOM.meta.decidim. The document also takes concepts and procedures from Barcelona City Council’s new participatory regulations which are expected to be approved on 29 September and were developed on a participatory basis through the decidim.barcelona portal. In preparation for the 2017 Annual Metadecidim Conferences and the need to coordinate the implementation of prospective functions with various municipal technical teams and to publish an up-to-date roadmap, the Decidim team began to draft this document as a reference to the current and proposed Decidim functions for the 2017-2018 period.</td>

# Authorship criteria and how to contribute to this document

This document is open to participation. You may contribute to this document in several different ways. Except for the editing function, all other forms of participation and authorship levels and criteria are stated below:

* *Editor:* Responsible for monitoring a text and its versions, corrections and structure etc., and may or may not be one of the authors. In essence, an editor is someone who coordinates collaboration on the text. One of the editor's responsibilities is to request and read revisions.

* *Authors*: Strictly speaking, authors are those who have drafted the text. The order of the authors listed reflects their contribution, with the first mentioned being the one who has written the most. Authors must have read and revised their text in its final or previous versions, although they do not have to agree with its final form, a task that falls to the editor.

* *Contributor*: Two groups of contributors are considered here. On the one hand, the document's academic revisers (where they have made a considerable contribution) and, on the other, external collaborators whose contributions have been valuable and integrated in parts of the text included in the document. It is up to the editor and other authors to decide who is a contributor or an author, although the former is in any case meant to contribute less than the latter. As a general rule, a person who has written under 10% of the text ought to be considered a contributor rather than an author. By the same token, being a contributor means having written at least two or three paragraphs.

* *Participant*: This is someone who has not contributed any specific text to the document but who has made valuable contributions such as observations about the document or provided valuable criteria, references or elements of discussion.

* *Proofreader*: Their work includes carefully reading an entire text, correcting errors and suggesting improvements. Such work is generally commissioned (requested from a person regarded as competent in the field), although it is possible for someone to contribute by proofreading a text that has not been explicitly requested. In such cases, the depth and quality of the proofreading process may qualify a person to be considered as a proofreader. (NOTE:  This division and specification of authorship levels has been copied directly from the criteria established under the FLOK Society - Buen conocer project (see: Barandiaran et al. 2015, pp. 38-39).)
