# 4	Participants

## 4.1	Registration and verification

Any visitor can access all of the websiteâ€™s content directly. However, anyone who wishes to submit proposals or comments will have to **register**. Users may register **directly** on the platform or through gateways to other **social networks** (Facebook, Twitter or Google+). Users will need an associated email account and a user-account password to register directly.

Decision-orientated functions (endorsements, votes etc.,) require **verification**. The main verification method cross-checks against the municipal register and other databases that people have registered with whom Decidim can communicate via API. Users may also be verified **by text** or using a special **code** sent by post or other means. Also, from the administration panel allows a participant to be **manually verified** [functions expected for 2018Q1-3, AjB-Lote1].

Besides the verification process, participants can also ask to have their user name **made official**. Once made official, their user name will appear with a symbol that allows third parties to acknowledge that this user name corresponds to the person it claims to be.

**Associations and organisations** whose identity can be verified in some way can also be registered and verified. The official name status will be automatically verified.

## 4.2	Public registration of administrative activity

The manual verification of participants, as well as other administrative actions can create vulnerability or may enable the platform's administrators to use the functions in an abusive manner. To that end, Decidim includes a **public register of administrative activities** so these actions can be publicly and transparently audited.

## 4.3	User profile and personal settings

There is a **user-profile page **where participants can make **changes to their data **(such as email account, password etc.), upload and enable an **avatar** image, set notifications and unsubscribe.

The user-profile page also allows participants to add **additional information** to include interests and skills, voluntarily and by selecting the level of visibility of that information. This allows personal notifications to be sent and participants can be matched with others for collaborations [function expected for 2018Q1-3, AjB-Lote1].

## 4.4	Monitoring and notifications

Participants receive **automated notifications** regarding the content they have created: responses to comments and comments on their proposals, as well as the results of their proposals (whether accepted or rejected).

Besides automated notifications, participants can decide to **follow any element **of the system (other proposals, results, processes, assemblies, initiatives, groups or users etc.), and receive notifications [function expected for 2017Q3, GenCat].

## 4.5	Communication among participants

**Instant messages **can be sent to participants through the platform, who will receive an email notification [function expected for 2017Q3, AjB].

**Tags** can also be added (in the comments section) to any registered user and a notification will be automatically sent. [function expected for 2018Q1-3, AjB-Lote1]

## 4.6	Engagement

Decidim has a series of functions geared to *gamifying* the platform, to **attract and keep a growing number of participants interested**, as well as to promote practices that boost democratic quality and collective intelligence in participation [the gamification system is expected for 2018Q1-3, AjB-Lote1]. 

The gamification system includes two modes, one centred on users and the other on proposals.

* The **user-centred **mode incorporates a **points system** based on several criteria (degree of detail of its user profile, number of invitations to others on the platform, number of proposals made and commented on, number of observations, number of endorsements obtained, number of followers, etc.)

The combination of these and other indicators is used for generating gamification routes for each user and defining threads such as: most participatory person in the district, leadership in discussions and debates, etc.

* Gamification **centred on proposals/initiatives** allows promoters, signatories and followers to boost interaction with them by incorporating several **metrics** (number of times that the proposal is shared in social networks, degree of controversy (number of positive and negative observations), quality of deliberation (depth of observation tree), number of hits received, etc.

## 4.7	User groups

Participants can register with the platform as members of one or several organisations/collectives. Once the organisation and membership status have been verified, participants can carry out actions (make proposals or submit comments, etc.), with their user or organisation name. [Function expected for 2018Q1-3, AjB-Lote1]

User groups can also manage user and administrative accesses assigned to groups, as well as private debate spaces or share information between user groups, for example, who attended an in-person meeting. [Function expected for 2018Q1-3, AjB-Lote1]
