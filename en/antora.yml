      Decidim (https://decidim.org) is a digital infrastructure for
      participatory democracy written on free software (Ruby on Rails), which
      enables the creation of citizen participation portals. Users of the
      platform (participants) interact through participatory mechanisms known as
      components which provide specific functions for the various participatory
      spaces. In other words, participatory spaces such as Initiatives,
      Assemblies, Processes and Consultations have components at their disposal
      which work together as participatory mechanisms. The more notable
      components include in-person meetings, surveys, proposals, votes, results
      monitoring and comments. For example, the various stages of a specific
      participatory process, such as the preparation of participatory budgets,
      can incorporate various components to: convene and capture the results of
      in-person meetings with citizens, conduct a survey, make proposals and,
      during the final stages of the process, hold a vote to decide on the
      projects with a budget expenditure system (always after a period for
      commentary and debate), conduct an assessment survey and, finally, monitor
      the implementation of the projects selected.
